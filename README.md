# Database-design-and-implementation

Project Overview

This project involved designing and implementing a relational database for the Bachelor of Software Engineering (BSA) program to manage and analyze course data, learning outcomes, textbooks, and professor assignments. The database adheres to 3NF/BCNF normalization principles and supports advanced data manipulation queries.

Features

Normalization: Converted raw data into 3NF/BCNF and created a detailed Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) using Microsoft Visio.
Database Implementation: Created tables with primary/foreign key constraints and inserted sample data.
Advanced SQL Queries: Performed complex data analysis tasks, such as calculating CLO statistics, generating views, and identifying course attributes.
Scalability: Designed for easy adaptability to additional program requirements.

Tools and Technologies

Database Management: MySQL
Diagramming: Microsoft Visio
Programming: SQL

How to Use

Setup the Database:
Execute Asg2.SQL to create and populate the database.
Query the Database:
Use the SQL queries provided in the documentation to retrieve insights such as CLO analysis, course prerequisites, and textbook publishers.
Demo and Testing:
Present the ERD and demonstrate the queries as outlined in the assignment requirements.

Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I developed skills in database normalization, schema design, SQL scripting, and advanced query analysis while collaborating effectively in a team environment.
